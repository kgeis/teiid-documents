= DDL Commands

{{ book.productnameFull }} supports a subset of DDL at runtime to create/drop temporary tables and to manipulate procedure and view definitions. It is not currently possible to arbitrarily drop/create non-temporary metadata entries.Â  See link:DDL_Metadata.adoc[DDL Metadata] for DDL used within a VDB to define schemas.

NOTE: A `MetadataRepository` must be configured to make a non-temporary metadata update persistent. See the Developers Guide Runtime Metadata Updates section for more.
