= PostgreSQL Translator (postgresql)

Also see common link:JDBC_Translators.adoc[JDBC Translator Information]

The PostgreSQL Translator, known by the type name *_postgresql_*, is for use with 8.0 or later clients and 7.1 or later server.

== Execution Properties

PostgreSQL specific execution properties:

* _PostGisVersion_- indicate the PostGIS version in use. Defaults to 0 meaning PostGIS is not installed. Will be set automatically if the database version is not set.
* _ProjSupported_- boolean indicating if Proj is support for PostGis. Will be set automatically if the database version is not set.

NOTE: Some driver versions of PostgreSQL will not associate columns to "INDEX" type tables.  Later versions of {{ book.productnameFull }} will omit these tables automatically.  Older versions of {{ book.productnameFull }} may need the importer.tableType property or other filtering set.
