= INTO Clause

WARNING: Usage of the INTO Clause for inserting into a table has been been deprecated. An INSERT with a query command should be used instead.

When the into clause is specified with a SELECT, the results of the query are inserted into the specified table. This is often used to insert records into a temporary table. The INTO clause immediately precedes the FROM clause.

Usage:

[source,sql]
----
INTO table FROM ...
----

Syntax Rules:

* The INTO clause is logically applied last in processing, after the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses.

* {{ book.productnameFull }}â€™s support for SELECT INTO is similar to MS SQL Server. The target of the INTO clause is a table where the result of the rest select command will be inserted. SELECT INTO should not be used UNION query.
