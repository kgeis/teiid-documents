= System Schema

The built-in SYS and SYSADMIN schemas provide metadata tables and procedures against the current VDB.

By default a system schema for ODBC metadata pg_catalog is also exposed - however that should be considered for general use.

== Metadata Visibility

The SYS system schema tables and procedures are always visible/accessible.

Unlike {{ book.productnameFull }} 8.x and prior releases when link:Data_Roles.adoc[Data Roles] are in use table/views and procedure metadata entries will not be visible if the 
user is not entitled by some permission to use the object.  All columns of a key
must be accessible for the entry to be visible.  

NOTE: If you wish all metadata to be visible to any authenticated user, then set the environment/system property org.teiid.metadataRequiresPermission to false.

NOTE: If there is any caching of system metadata when data roles are in use, then visibility needs to be considered.
