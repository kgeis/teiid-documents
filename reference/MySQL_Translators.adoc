= MySQL Translator (mysql/mysql5)

Also see common link:JDBC_Translators.adoc[JDBC Translator Information]

MySQL/MariaDB translation is supported by 2 translators.

== mysql

The Mysql translator, known by the type name *_mysql_*, is for use with MySQL version 4.x.

== mysql5

The Mysql5 translator, known by the type name *_mysql5_*, is for use with MySQL version 5 or later.

Also supports compatible MySQL derivatives including MariaDB.

== Usage

The MySQL Translators expect the database or session to be using ANSI mode. If the database is not using ANSI mode, an initialization query should be used on the pool to set ANSI mode:

[source,sql]
----
set SESSION sql_mode = 'ANSI'
----

If you may deal with null timestamp values, then set the connection property zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull. Otherwise youâ€™ll get conversion errors in {{ book.productnameFull }} that `0000-00-00 00:00:00' cannot be converted to a timestamp.

WARNING: If retrieving large result sets, you should consider setting the connection property useCursorFetch=true, otherwise MySQL will fully fetch result sets into memory on the {{ book.productnameFull }} instance.

NOTE: MySQL reports TINYINT(1) columns as a JDBC BIT type - however the value range is not actually restricted and may cause issues if for example you are relying on -1 being recognized as a true value.  
If not using the native importer, you should change affected source BOOLEAN columns to have a native type of "TINYINT(1)" rather than BIT so that the translator can appropriately handle the boolean conversion.
