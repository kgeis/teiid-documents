== Known Issues

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-3805[TEIID-3805] - The pushdown of the substring function is inconsistent with the {{ book.productnameFull }} substring function when the from index exceeds the length of the string. SAP Hana will return an empty string, while {{ book.productnameFull }} produces a null value.
