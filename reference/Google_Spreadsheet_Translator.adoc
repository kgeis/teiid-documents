= Google Spreadsheet Translator

The _google-spreadsheet_ translator is used to connect to a Google Spreadsheet.

The query approach expects the data in the worksheet to be in a specific format. Namely:

* Any column that has data is queryable.
* Any column with an empty cell has the value retrieved as null.  However differentiating between null string and empty string values may not
always be possible as google treats them interchanably.  Where possible the translator may provide a warning or throw an exception if there may be
a confusion of null vs. empty strings.
* If the first row is present and contains string values, then it will be assumed to represent the column labels.

If you are using the default native metadata import, the metadata for your Google account (worksheets and information about columns in worksheets) are loaded upon translator start up. If you make any changes in data types, it is advisable to restart your vdb.

The translator supports queries against a single sheet. It supports ordering, aggregation, basic predicates, and most of the functions supported by the spreadsheet query language.

There are no google-spreadsheet importer settings, but it can provide metadata for VDBs.

WARNING: A sheet with a header that is defined in {{ book.productnameFull }}, which later has all data rows removed is no longer valid for access through {{ book.productnameFull }}.  The google api will treat the header as a data row at that point and thus queries will no longer be valid.

WARNING: Non-string fields are updated using the canonical {{ book.productnameFull }} SQL value - in cases where the spreadsheet is using a non-conforming locale, consider disallowing updates.  See also link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-4854[TEIID-4854] and the allTypesUpdatable import property below.

== Importer Properties 

* _allTypesUpdatable_- Set to true to mark all columns as updatable. Set to false to enable update only on string/boolean columns, which are not affected by link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-4854[TEIID-4854]. Defaults to true.

== JCA Resource Adapter

The {{ book.productnameFull }} specific Google Spreadsheet Data Sources Resource Adapter should be used with this translator.

== Native Queries

Google spreadsheet source procedures may be created using the teiid_rel:native-query extension - see link:Translators.adoc#_parameterizable_native_queries[Parameterizable Native Queries]. The procedure will invoke the native-query similar to an native procedure call with the benefits that the query is predetermined and that result column types are known, rather than requiring the use of ARRAYTABLE or similar functionality. See the link:Google_Spreadsheet_Translator.adoc#_select[Select] format below.

=== Direct Query Procedure

NOTE: This feature is turned off by default because of the security risk this exposes to execute any command against the source. To enable this feature, link:Translators.adoc#_override_execution_properties[override the execution property] called _SupportsDirectQueryProcedure_ to true.

TIP: By default the name of the procedure that executes the queries directly is called *native*. link:Translators.adoc#_override_execution_properties[Override the execution property] _DirectQueryProcedureName_ to change it to another name.

The Google spreadsheet translator provides a procedure to execute any ad-hoc query directly against the source without any {{ book.productnameFull }} parsing or resolving. Since the metadata of this procedureâ€™s execution results are not known to {{ book.productnameFull }}, they are returned as an object array. link:ARRAYTABLE.adoc[ARRAYTABLE] can be used construct tabular output for consumption by client applications. {{ book.productnameFull }} exposes this procedure with a simple query structure as below:

=== Select

[source,sql]
.*Select Example*
----
SELECT x.* FROM (call google_source.native('worksheet=People;query=SELECT A, B, C')) w,
 ARRAYTABLE(w.tuple COLUMNS "id" string , "type" string, "name" String) AS x
----

the first argument takes semi-colon(;) separated name value pairs of following properties to execute the procedure:

|===
|Property |Description |Required

|worksheet
|Google spreadsheet name
|yes

|query
|spreadsheet query
|yes

|limit
|number rows to fetch
|no

|offset
|offset of rows to fetch from limit or beginning
|no
