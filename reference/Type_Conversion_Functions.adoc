= Type Conversion Functions

Within your queries, you can convert between datatypes using the CONVERT or CAST keyword. See also link:Type_Conversions.html[Type Conversions]

|===
|Function |Definition

|CONVERT(x, type)
|Convert x to type, where type is a {{ book.productnameFull }} Base Type

|CAST(x AS type)
|Convert x to type, where type is a {{ book.productnameFull }} Base Type
|===

These functions are identical other than syntax; CAST is the standard SQL syntax, CONVERT is the standard JDBC/ODBC syntax.

IMPORTANT: Options that are specified on the type, such as length, precision, scale, etc., are effectively ignored - the runtime is simply converting from one object type to another.
