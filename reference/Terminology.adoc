* Session – the Session service manages active session information.

* Buffer Manager – the link:Data_Management.adoc#_buffer_management[Buffer Manager] service provides access to data management for intermediate results.

* Transaction – the Transaction service manages global, local, and request scoped transactions.  See also the documentation on link:Transaction_Support.adoc[Transaction Support].
