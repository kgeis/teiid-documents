= Scalar Functions

{{ book.productnameFull }} provides an extensive set of built-in scalar functions. See also link:DML_Commands.adoc[SQL Support] and link:Datatypes.adoc[Datatypes]. In addition, {{ book.productnameFull }} provides the capability for user defined functions or UDFs. See the Developers Guide for adding UDFs. Once added UDFs may be called just like any other function.
