= AutoCommitTxn Execution Property

Since user level commands may execute multiple source commands, users can specify the AutoCommitTxn execution property to control the transactional behavior of a user command when not in a local or global transaction.

.*AutoCommitTxn Settings*
|===
|Setting |Description

|OFF
|Do not wrap each command in a transaction. Individual source commands may commit or rollback regardless of the success or failure of the overall command.

|ON
|Wrap each command in a transaction. This mode is the safest, but may introduce performance overhead.

|DETECT
|This is the default setting. Will automatically wrap commands in a transaction, but only if the command seems to be transactionally unsafe.
|===

The concept of command safety with respect to a transaction is determined by {{ book.productnameFull }} based upon command type, the transaction isolation level, and available metadata. A wrapping transaction is not needed if:

* If a user command is fully pushed to the source.
* If the user command is a SELECT (including XML) and the transaction isolation is not REPEATABLE_READ nor SERIALIABLE.
* If the user command is a stored procedure and the transaction isolation is not REPEATABLE_READ nor SERIALIABLE and the link:Updating_Model_Count.adoc[Updating Model Count] is zero.

The update count may be set on all procedures as part of the procedure metadata in the model.
