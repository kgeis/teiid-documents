= Caching Guide

{{ book.productnameFull }} provides several capabilities for caching data including: 

1. Materialized views
2. ResultSet caching
3. Code table caching 

These techniques can be used to significantly improve performance in many situations.

With the exception of external materialized views, the cached data is accessed through the BufferManager. In some cases the BufferManager setting can be adjusted to the particular memory constraints of your installation.
