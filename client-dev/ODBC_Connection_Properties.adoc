= Configuring Connection Properties with ODBC

When working with ODBC connection, the user can set the connection properties link:Driver_Connection.adoc[Driver Connection#URL Connection Properties] 
that are available in {{ book.productnameFull }} by executing the command like below.

----
SET <property-name> TO <property-value>
----  

for example to turn on the result set caching you can issue

----
SET resultSetCacheMode TO 'true'
----

Another option is to set this as VDB property in the vdb file as 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE vdb OPTIONS ("connection.partialResultsMode" true);
----

{% if book.targetWildfly %}
Or in an XML VDB:
----
<vdb name="...">
    <property name="connection.resultSetCacheMode" value="true"/>
    ...
</vdb>
----
{% endif %}
